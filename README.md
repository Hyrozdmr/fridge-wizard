## Application structure
Fridge Wizard uses a React framework with Javascript, a Django backend with Python and a Mongo database. Fridge Wizard's frontend uses Axios to make requests to the backend, and the backend uses Pymongo to make HTTP requests to the MongoDB.

## Installing Fridge Wizard
To install Fridge Wizard locally:
### Clone Git repository
Go to GitHub and clone the whole Git repo.

### Install dependencies
In a terminal, `cd` to `fridge-wizard/frontend/`. In the CLI, execute `npm install` to install dependencies.

In another terminal, `cd` to `fridge-wizard/backend/`. In the CLI, execute `pipenv install` to install dependencies.

## Running Fridge Wizard
To run Fridge Hero locally:
### Running the dev environment
You will need an active MongoDB connection to use most of Fridge Hero's features. MongoDB connections can be managed conveniently with the MongoDB Compass app. (You can download it from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass))

In another terminal, `cd` to `fridge-wizard/backend/`. In the CLI, execute `pipenv install` to update dependencies, then `pipenv shell` to start the virtual environment, then `python manage.py runserver` from within the virtual environment to run the backend server. By default, it runs on port 8000.

In a terminal, `cd` to `fridge-wizard/frontend/`. In the CLI, execute `npm install` to update dependencies, then `npm run start` to run the frontend server. By default, it runs on port 3000. Once the `frontend` starts succesfully it should then automatically open a browser window for you with Fridge Hero. 

Alternatively, if this doesn't happen automatically; while the servers are running, open your browser of choice and navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to begin using Fridge Hero.

## Running tests
A suite of backend tests are included with Fridge Hero. All tests files are in `fridge-wizard/backed/tests/` and use Python's unittest library to perform tests.

To run all tests, `cd` to `fridge-wizard/backend`. In the CLI, execute `python -m unittest discover -v -s tests -p '*_test.py'`.

The outcome of each test will be printed in the terminal console.
